Welcome to my website!  I'm under construction right now, but I"m using the 
construction to hone my web design skills.  This site uses a framework 
called <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, mixing HTML, Markdown, and
Liquid.

Here's what I expect to have on this website:

- Personal portfolio/resume
- Creations (music or poetry)
- Blogs (likely music, technology, and math related)
- Other cool things (such as playlists and cool links!)  


Keep an eye out for updates!
